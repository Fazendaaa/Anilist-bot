## Acknowledgments

Huge thanks to [Juan Soto](https://github.com/sotojuan) and the awesome and easy to use Anilist wrapper that he made it. And the folks behind Telegraf for an awsome and well documented API. Without these kinda of people and their works it would be harder to make this bot.

## TODO

* Integration with wit.ia
